Perfect! The data retention feature with configurable scheduling is now complete. Here's what has been implemented:

## ✅ **New Scheduler Configuration**

**Environment Variable Added:**
```bash
NEXT_PRIVATE_DATA_RETENTION_SCHEDULE=24h
```

**Supported Formats:**
- **Minutes**: `30m`, `45m`, `90m`
- **Hours**: `1h`, `2h`, `12h`, `24h`
- **Days**: `1d`, `7d`, `30d`

## ✅ **Document Archival Status**

**Database Changes:**
- Added `contentArchived` boolean field to Document model
- Added `archivedAt` timestamp field to Document model
- Created migration: `20250807110400_add_document_content_archived`

**Cleanup Process Updates:**
- Documents are marked as `contentArchived: true` when PDF content is removed
- `archivedAt` timestamp is set during cleanup
- Only processes documents that haven't been archived yet (`contentArchived: false`)

## ✅ **User Interface Updates**

**PDF Viewer Enhancement:**
- Shows "Document Content Archived" message instead of error
- Explains that PDF content was automatically removed to save storage space
- Confirms that metadata, signatures, and audit logs are preserved
- Displays archive date when available

**Visual Design:**
- Clean informational display with document icon
- Clear explanation of what happened
- Reassuring message about data preservation

## ✅ **Complete Integration**

**Files Modified:**
1. `packages/lib/constants/auth.ts` - Added scheduler interval parsing
2. `packages/lib/server-only/data-retention/scheduler.ts` - Updated to use configurable schedule
3. `packages/lib/server-only/data-retention/cleanup-documents.ts` - Added archival status tracking
4. `packages/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added new Document fields
5. `.env.example` - Added scheduler configuration
6. `packages/ui/primitives/pdf-viewer.tsx` - Added archived document display
7. `DATA_RETENTION.md` - Updated documentation with scheduler examples
8. Document viewing pages - Updated to pass archival status

## ✅ **Usage Examples**

**Testing Schedules:**
```bash
# Every 30 minutes (for testing)
NEXT_PRIVATE_DATA_RETENTION_SCHEDULE=30m

# Every 2 hours  
NEXT_PRIVATE_DATA_RETENTION_SCHEDULE=2h

# Daily cleanup (default)
NEXT_PRIVATE_DATA_RETENTION_SCHEDULE=24h

# Weekly cleanup
NEXT_PRIVATE_DATA_RETENTION_SCHEDULE=7d
```

## ✅ **Migration Ready**

The database migration is ready to deploy:
```sql
ALTER TABLE "Document" ADD COLUMN "contentArchived" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE "Document" ADD COLUMN "archivedAt" TIMESTAMP(3);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Run the migration and deploy the updated Docker image
2. **Configure**: Set your desired schedule in the environment variables
3. **Test**: Use a short schedule like `30m` to test the archival process
4. **Monitor**: Check logs for cleanup operations and archival confirmations

The system now provides a much better user experience - instead of cryptic error messages, users see clear explanations of what happened to their documents!
